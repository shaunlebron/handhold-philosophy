# Handhold Philosophy

_(TODO: organize and distill better)_

Learning something unfamiliar or trying to build something difficult can
be an intensely frustrating, emotional experience.  We are influenced by
these feelings to give up because we are either convinced of one of the following:

1. failure is certain (boundary of certainty)
2. success is possible, but not worth the pain (boundary of interest)
3. failure is highly probable (boundary of fear)

## Boundaries

### Certainty

It is either experience or ignorance that makes us certain of failure (1).
Experience implies that we have tried the thing.  Ignorance implies that we are
relating it too losely to something familiar. So when we try a thing and hit
a boundary, we need to be assessing which one we're hitting and why.

### Disinterest

We give up at the boundary of interest (2) when we don't care anymore.  This
can be a result of shifting life priorities, effects of the menial troughs,
or the result of a burnout in which the mind just needs time to recover before
resuming.

### Fear

The hardest boundary to react to is the boundary of fear (3) because it is a
constant slipping force.  There needs to be something holding us against this
force if we are to continue trying.  We need something we can comfortably grip
and climb with, or we will fall.  There is only one of these "handholds" that
I've been able to identify:

- the empowerment of simplicity

The learning process is a constant growth of inferences based on things that
are already familiar to us.  When we have grown our knowledge, we feel a rush of
empowerment to continue.  It is that energy that allows to do more difficult things
until we reach our next handhold.

To put it plainly, it is emotionally important to have moments when I think
"Okay, THIS I get. This I understand." It's the only thing that mobilizes me to
my next aha moment.  Learning becomes a constant chain reaction of these moments.

### The interplay of Fear and Disinterest

Once the chain reaction of simplicity empowers us to familiarity and
drives away fear, the actual work to build a difficult thing begins.  And suddenly
we have to context switch to a different kind of handhold.  And during this,
we may hit something unfamiliar again, forcing another context switch back.

I think that it is the interplay of these two contexts that makes it difficult to
continue because we get used to solving one and get tripped up by the switch.

### Handholds for disinterest

The handholds for helping against disinterest are visibility of progress,
positive feedback, and interest in other tasks.  I think it's common for
sizable projects to have multiple types of tasks to be worked on, and finding
one that aligns an interest can provide energy that can be spent on parts of
the project that are not so interesting. Writing helps solidify progress, the
visiblity of which provides energy.
